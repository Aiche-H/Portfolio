            <h1><u>Information</u></h1>

            <p>
                As a passionate developer based in <u>Finland</u>, I blend my technical expertise with an adventurous
                spirit.<br>
                Currently pursuing a <u>Vocational Qualification in Information and Communication Technology</u>, I'm
                constantly expanding my programming
                horizons beyond the curriculum. <br><br>

                My technical journey spans multiple languages and frameworks, including <u>React.js</u>, <u>Golang</u>,
                <u>Python</u>, <u>C++</u>, and <u>TypeScript</u>.<br>
                While <u>VS Code</u> serves as my primary editor, I enjoy exploring alternatives like <u>NeoVim</u>,<br>
                which has led me to dive into <u>Lua</u> programming â€“ highlighting my enthusiasm for understanding the
                tools I use at a deeper level. <br><br>

                When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me seeking the perfect balance through outdoor
                activities.<br>
                Whether it's taking contemplative walks in Finland's beautiful nature or pursuing the adrenaline rush of
                extreme sports,<br>
                these experiences help me maintain a clear mind and fresh perspective in my technical endeavors.
                <br><br>

                What truly drives me is my insatiable curiosity about how things work under the hood.<br>
                This mindset not only makes me a better developer but also fuels my continuous learning journey in the
                ever-evolving tech landscape.<br>
                I believe that understanding the fundamentals of technology is just as important as mastering its
                practical applications.
